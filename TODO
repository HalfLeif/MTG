# Functionality
- Can play land after drawing if did not play land in first main
- Support spell with mana cost X and use when appropriate. Reward is X-1.

# Implementation
- Use string_view for parsing mana costs.
- Use std::array<int>, perhaps with thin wrapper to represent ManaCost instead of std::map.
- Use thin wrapper (pointer type) instead of copying Spells when simulating.
