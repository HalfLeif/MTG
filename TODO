# Functionality
- Can play land after drawing if did not play land in first main
- Support spell with mana cost X and use when appropriate. Reward is X-1.
- Search for reasonable land combinations using only few iterations (25), and then refine best N of those with more iterations (200). Can do recursively for top N-1 with more iterations until stable order?
- Limit number of colors to 2 for some threads. Limit to 3 for other threads. Or perhaps choose colors per thread in advance? Currently gets stuck at 3 color decks...

# Suggest deck
- Instead of replacing with a uniform random card, also keep track of past card contribution and topk sample based on contribution. Consider unknown cards as high contribution, but always update with latest simulation.
- Parse spell abilities from html page. E.g. "RR" to +1/0.
